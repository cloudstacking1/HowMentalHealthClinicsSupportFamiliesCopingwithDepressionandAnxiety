  <h2>The Therapy Process: What You Can Expect</h2>

  <h3>Initial Intake & Verification</h3>
  <p>
   When you search for a mental health clinic near me, or look for a mental health specialist, it’s helpful to have a decision-making checklist. Here’s what you should consider:
  </p>

  <h3>Assessment & Personalized Treatment Planning</h3>
  <p>
    Your therapist collaborates with you to set measurable goals, modalities (therapy, psychiatry, or both), and projected frequency of sessions.
  </p>

  <h3>Consistent Sessions & Progress Monitoring</h3>
  <p>
    Sessions typically last 45–60 minutes, scheduled weekly initially and adjusted over time. We assess progress regularly, adjusting care plans as needed.
  </p>

  <h3>Integrated Coordinated Support</h3>
  <p>
    If psychiatric care is recommended, your psychiatrist works closely with your therapist to ensure cohesive support.
  </p>

  <h3>Crisis Planning & Aftercare Support</h3>
  <p>
    After the initial phase, we offer maintenance planning, referrals, and emergency protocols to ensure continued support beyond core treatment.
